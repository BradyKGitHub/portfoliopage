  <h3>About Me</h3>
	 <article>
<p> I moved to the Raleigh, NC area during the summer of 2021 with my girlfriend Haley. When we moved, I wanted to find a way out of the customer service industry into something more enjoyable and fun. I have always had an interest in software engineering, but I never thought it would be easy to get into without a college degree.</p>
<p> Throughout the start of the prep course, I have enjoyed learning and spending the time to hone my skills in coding. The more time I spend going through the different modules, the more excited I get to work with other individuals who share the same mindset and passion as I do. Teamwork is something that makes me strive to learn more and perfect my own work.  </p>
	<p> A list of coding languages I am comfortable with include:</p>
	<ol class="list-inside">
		<li>Html </li>
		<li>CSS </li>
		<li>JavaScript </li>
	</ol>
